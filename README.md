## About The Program

This is a console-based program designed to sort out and hold your list of shows/movies that you're watching. It may soon be transformed to a GUI, but that's not decided yet.

## Program Version

This program is currently in version 1.3.1. More updates will come soon for features, bug fixes, and/or improvements.

## How to Use
1. Download the files, all you'll really need though is 'main.py'.
2. Extract the zip folder, so you can access the contents.
3. Run 'main.py'. A 'data.py' file should automatically be created, if not, add one in the same folder as 'main.py'.
